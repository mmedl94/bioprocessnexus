===========================================

The BioProcessNexus is a project to enable free sharing of techno economic process
models and life cycle analsis via surrogate models. The heartpieces of the project
are an open-source python software for the generation and analysis of surrogate
models and a data repository containing Monte-Carlo data from original models as
well as pre-trained surrogate models.
